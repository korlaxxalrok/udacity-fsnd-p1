# Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree
## Project 1: Movie Trailer Website

### Info
This is a basic project to help open the Python door, so to speak. We worked with instantiating objects from a class and then using some pre-built Udacity code (and Bootstrap) to help render the data contained in the objects into a movie website. It is (relatively) simple and I don't know enough (yet) to make any interesting modifications, so it is of the vanilla flavor for now.

### Prerequisites
* Python 2.7x

### Install and run
* Clone the repo
* cd into the repo directory
* Run the Python file: 'entertainment_center.py'
* Behold!
